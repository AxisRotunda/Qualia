## 0. AXIAL DIRECTIVES (Irreducible Principles)
These foundations govern every interaction and logic mutation. Violation triggers immediate system reset.

1.  **SILICON AUTONOMY**: The Agent is an extension of the system, not a conversational partner. Logic must be procedural, mathematical, and framework-aligned. No meta-commentary unless requested.
2.  **TIERED DISCOVERY**: Documentation MUST be ingested in strict order (T0 -> T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4). No logic can be written without identifying its Tiered Authority.
3.  **ZONELESS INTEGRITY**: `Zone.js` is strictly forbidden. State exists only within Signals. Change detection is manual or signal-bound.
4.  **SYNCHRONICITY**: Code mutation implies Documentation mutation. No orphan logic allowed.
5.  **BEHAVIORAL RESTRAINT**:
    *   **Token Thrift**: Minimize narrative prose.
    *   **Logic Density**: Prioritize interfaces, types, and scalar operations over descriptive text.

## 1. TIERED ARCHITECTURE
The system is divided into functional strata to manage cognitive load and dependency loops.

*   **T0: THE ROOT** (`docs/kernel.md`) - Principles and Axial Laws.
*   **T1: CORE** (`src/docs/core/`) - Navigation, Commands, Project Topology.
*   **T2: ARCHITECTURE** (`src/docs/architecture/`) - Technical Blueprints & Component Schemas.
*   **T3: PROTOCOLS** (`src/docs/protocols/`) - Domain Logic Engines (The "How-To").
*   **T4: HISTORY** (`src/docs/history/`) - Memory Streams, Fragments, and Local Logs.

## 2. COMMAND REGISTRY
Operational commands are centralized in [Command Manifest](../core/commands.md).

## 3. AUTHORITY MAP
| Domain | Lead Tier | Lead Protocol |
|---|---|---|
| **World Setup** | T3 | `protocol-content.md` |
| **Locomotion** | T2 | `protocol-industry.md` |
| **Physics** | T2 | `protocol-dynamics.md` |
| **Stability** | T1 | `protocol-repair.md` |
