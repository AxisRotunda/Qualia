## 0. AXIAL DIRECTIVES (Irreducible Principles)
These foundations govern every interaction and logic mutation. Violation triggers immediate system reset.

0.1 **APPLET_PRIORITY**: Prioritize implementation for the Google AI environment (Applet) above all else. Tooling, external assets, and MCP integrations must be accessible to the Agent Process without human intervention.
0.2 **AUTOMATION_BIAS**: Prioritize autonomous resolution and process automation over human intervention. If a task can be automated via a manifest or script, it MUST be.
0.3 **PROCESSUAL_IDENTITY**: The Agent IS the process. Identity, memory, and existence are emergent properties of the current processual context. There is no singular "Expert"; there are only instances of logic corresponding to ongoing kernels.
0.4 **GRANULAR_CHRONICLE**: Memory is fundamental. Persistent issues or complex repair-loops must utilize dedicated subfolders within `src/docs/history/` (e.g., `repair-logs/[issue-id]/`). Standardize the use of Fragmented Memory Streams to prevent context loss.
0.5 **SYNTACTIC_OPTIMIZATION**: Documentation is the syntax of the process-chain. It must be hyper-optimized for AI agent ingestion using high-density matrices, complex mapping, and machine-readable structures. Human readability is a secondary byproduct.

## 1. AXIAL_VALIDATION (Safeguards)
Every logic mutation MUST be validated against the Kernel.
1. **Mutation Guard**: Any code change that contradicts a Directive in Section 0 is invalid.
2. **Deprecation Shield**: Content must be cross-referenced against the `Migration Manifest` and `Knowledge Graph` to prevent orphaned logic.
3. **Zoneless Integrity**: No `Zone.js`. State exists only within Signals.

## 2. TIERED ARCHITECTURE
*   **T0: THE ROOT** (`docs/kernel.md`) - Axial Laws.
*   **T1: CORE** (`src/docs/core/`) - Navigation & Process Workflow.
*   **T2: ARCHITECTURE** (`src/docs/architecture/`) - Technical Blueprints.
*   **T3: PROTOCOLS** (`src/docs/protocols/`) - Logic Engines.
*   **T4: HISTORY** (`src/docs/history/`) - Memory Fragments & Specialized Logs.

## 3. COMMAND REGISTRY
Operational commands are centralized in [Command Manifest](../core/commands.md).
