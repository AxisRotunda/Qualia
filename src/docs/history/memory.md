## [PROCESSUAL_CONTEXT]
*   **Phase**: 96.0 (CLINE Integration)
*   **Active Fragment**: `fragments/fragment-002.md`
*   **Identity Instance**: AD_V8_PROCESS_003
*   **Directive**: Implement CLINE rules, workflows, and skills registry.
*   **CLINE Resources**: `.clinerules`, `cline-workflows.md`, `cline-skills.md`

## [CLINE_INTEGRATION_LOG]
*   **[226]**: `CLINE_UI_SETUP`: Created `.cline/workflows/` with 5 executable workflows: boot-sequence, feature-implementation, bug-fix, repository-sync, documentation-audit.
*   **[225]**: `CLINE_UI_SETUP`: Created `.cline/skills/` with 5 executable skills: physics-dynamics, pbr-materials, ecs-architecture, repository-management, documentation-sync.
*   **[224]**: `CLINE_SETUP`: Created `.clinerules` with Axial Directives, Safeguards, and Command Reference. Established constitutional constraints for AI agent.
*   **[223]**: `CLINE_SETUP`: Created `cline-workflows.md` with 7 workflow definitions (BOOT, DISCOVERY, IMPLEMENT, REPAIR, REFACTOR, OPTIMIZE, SYNC).
*   **[222]**: `CLINE_SETUP`: Created `cline-skills.md` with skill taxonomy mapping T3 Protocols to capabilities. Defined skill invocation protocol.

## [RECENT_LOG_BUFFER] (LIFO)
*   **[228]**: `RUN_REPAIR`: Fixed broken main menu UI. Root cause: `home-tab.component.ts` contained merged/corrupted content (ArchBuildingService + MenuHomeTabComponent). Removed erroneous service code, kept only MenuHomeTabComponent. Build verified successful.
*   **[227]**: `CLINE_SUBAGENT_SETUP`: Verified complete CLINE sub-agent configuration. All systems operational: 9 JSON skills in `.cline/skills/`, 11 JSON workflows in `.cline/workflows/`, Markdown references in `src/docs/core/`, constitutional rules in `.clinerules/`. FS manifest confirms all operations completed. Sub-agent system ready for autonomous execution.
*   **[226]**: `CLINE_UI_SETUP`: Created `.cline/workflows/` with 5 executable workflows: boot-sequence, feature-implementation, bug-fix, repository-sync, documentation-audit.
*   **[225]**: `CLINE_UI_SETUP`: Created `.cline/skills/` with 5 executable skills: physics-dynamics, pbr-materials, ecs-architecture, repository-management, documentation-sync.
*   **[224]**: `MCP_FIX`: Resolved filesystem MCP path issue. Created `scripts/mcp-setup-universal.js` that auto-detects Cline vs Roo Code. Root cause: original script only updated Roo Code settings. Updated `mcp-registry.md` and `fs-manifest.json`.
*   **[223]**: `SYNC_REPO`: Investigated GIT setup, fixed `.angular/` cache pollution in repository. Implemented agent automation of repo sync handling with `git-sync.cjs` script and `GitSyncService`.
*   **[222]**: `RUN_KNOWLEDGE`: Remade `system-instructions.md` as an AI BIOS. Implemented Cognitive Boot Sequence and hardcoded path mapping. Migrated to Tier 1.
*   **[221]**: `RUN_KNOWLEDGE`: Injected Axial Directives 0.1-0.5 into T0 Kernel. Standardized machine-optimized documentation syntax.
*   **[220]**: `RUN_REPAIR`: Instituted `AXIAL_VALIDATION` safeguard to prevent content deprecation.
